AI Chef is my first project working with Expo/React Native and my first time publishing to the Apple app store and Android app store. I worked really hard on this project to make the UI excellent for both the web and mobile, and I hope it shows from the user perspective.

I wanted to make and app that integrates with AI, both because it would be good practice for my API work and also because AI is everywhere now and I felt some coding experience with it would make me more marketable. This app uses the OpenAI API and runs GPT-4o mini.

The app itself is written with React and React Native and uses Nativewind and TailWind CSS to make that stunning UI. I love TailWind and I don't think I'll be using raw CSS for any of my personal projects anymore.

The app is desinged to help people cook! They can input their ingredients in the "pantry" tab and use the AI to generate recipes. Kind of simple but cool. I think the project was more focused on AI integration and incredible design, as opposed to groundbreaking functionality.

If you decide to replicate the app in VSC with my code, you'll basically need to use React and Expo. React makes this folder node_modules automatically, which helps it run. It's too big to add to Git, so you'll just have to generate it on your end. Expo does the same but with even more folders so some of that is missing from the source code.

Most of my code is in src for web, app for mobile, and sever for backend. Co ahead and take a look!
